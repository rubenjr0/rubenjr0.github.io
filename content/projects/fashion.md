One of my earliest adventures in computer vision and machine learning! So apologies for the quality of the code and the results.

I implemented both a CNN and an Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST classification (and regression, in the case of the Autoencoder) using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/rubenjr0/fashion-mnist-julia).
